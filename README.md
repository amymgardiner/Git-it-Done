## About Application

A user can search a specific user from GitHub to see all their repositories, and specifically the issues they have open. You can also search by open issues from all users, focusing on the languages those issues are in (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

The purpose of the app is to allow a user to find an issue they can help with on GitHub, as a way for users to become more involved in the coding community and as a way to practice their skills.
